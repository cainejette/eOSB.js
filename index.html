<p>* The first three rules should be read before each competition round begins, even if the teams choose to waive the reading of the rules.</p>

<p>Before we get started, I would like the coaches of both teams to come forward.  Please introduce yourselves, shake hands, and sit together in the back row.  Alternate team members should also come forward, introduce themselves, and sit at the back of the room during the match.</p>  

<p>Players please state your name and buzz-in to verify that your systems are working properly.</p>

<p>Please let me remind you and the audience of several important rules we will be carefully observing during this match.</p> 

   <p>  1. All electronic devices (i.e. cell phones, MP3 players, calculators, kindles) must be turned off and kept in a pocket, purse or bag throughout the entire competition round, even during the 2 minute break.</p>

     <p>2. Audience members may not take any notes, or review any reading materials (i.e. textbooks, novels, or papers), with the exception of the provided competition program, during the entire competition round, even including the 2 minute break.</p>

     <p>3. When a competition starts no one may leave or enter the room, except the approved event photographer and the room runners.</p> 

     <p>4. On toss-up questions, you MUST be verbally recognized by the Moderator before replying. If you respond before being verbally recognized, your team is automatically disqualified from answering the question. The question will then be offered as a toss-up question to the opposing team.</p>

     <p>5. In this match, I will identify you by saying either Team "A" or "B" and either Participant (or Player) "1", "2", "3", or "Captain".</p>

     <p>6. For toss-up questions there can be no conferring among team members ON EITHER TEAM at ANY time. If conferring occurs on the team that was initially recognized to answer the question, that team is disqualified from answering the question and the question is offered to the opposing team. If conferring occurs or has occurred, on the opposing team, they too are disqualified from answering the question.</p>

     <p>7. With the exception of articles such as "a," "an," and "the," answers to multiple choice questions must be exactly as those on the written page.  Prefacing the answer with "My answer is" is NOT acceptable on a toss-up question, but is optional on a bonus question.</p>

     <p>8. For bonus questions you have 20 seconds AFTER the Moderator finishes reading the question to begin your answer to the question. You will hear the Timekeeper say "5 SECONDS," when you have only 5 seconds left to begin your answer. If you fail to begin your answer before the Timekeeper says "TIME," you have missed your bonus question.</p>

     <p>9. For bonus questions only the team captain's answer will be accepted. Once the team captain begins his or her answer, no further conferring or clarification may occur by other team members.</p>

     <p>10. There are two types of challenges that team members may make during a game: challenges to the scientific answer and challenges to the enforcement of the competition rules. The team member requesting a challenge will raise their hand and request a challenge from the Moderator BEFORE the moderator begins the next question.  All challenges must come from the team members who are actively competing.  Neither the alternate nor any other audience member may object.</p>

     <p>11. If the challenge can be resolved in the room, the competition officials will collectively make a ruling on the challenge. If the team requesting the challenge disagrees with the first ruling, they can challenge a second and final time.</p>

     <p>12. For all challenges made a second time, it must go out of the competition room to the Judges' Appeal Room where all decisions are final. NO EXCEPTIONS.</p>

     <p>13. Only the timekeeper or other competition official can stop the game clock during a challenge.</p>

     <p>14. Competition officials may issue warnings to individual players, entire teams, or to members of the audience that display inappropriate behavior. The official verbal warning along with the reason for the warning will be issued by the Rules Judge. The warning(s) for both players and audience members will be noted on the Official Score Sheets and tallied throughout the entire competition.</p>

     <p>15. If a player or team receives two (2) official warnings throughout the entirety of the competition, that player or team will be disqualified from competing and will only be permitted to observe the competition.</p>

     <p>16. If an audience member receives two (2) official warnings they will not be permitted to observe or participate in the competition activities for the remainder of the event.</p>

<p>Are we all ready? Judges? Teams?  First question . . .</p>

        <p>It is time for the Team Challenge Questions.  During this portion of the competition, I would like to remind the audience that they should remain quiet and seated until the break is called.</p>

<p>Teams are encouraged to work together on this question; however, only the answer sheet handed in by the Captain will be graded.</p>  

<p>Please write your school name, the competition room, and the round, on the back of your sheets now. </p>

<p>The timekeeper will indicate when 45 seconds, and 15 seconds are remaining.  When time is called please put your pencils down. The papers will be collected from the Captain of each team and taken to the Judges' Appeals Room for grading.</p>
